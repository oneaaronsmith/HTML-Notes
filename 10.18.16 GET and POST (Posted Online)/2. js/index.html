            With forms, Get data is encoded automatically, before it is sent.
            If we construct an URL in JavaScript however, we must make sure that data is encoded.

            There are a number of illegal characters that could ruin our URL (:, &, /, ?, etc.)
            If we don't encode it, the ampersand in 'muA&M' would make the URL look like this:

            process.php?sid=muA&M

            That would make for one key/value pair with 'sid' = 'muA' and 'M' = to nothing.
